Ezpie is a free open-source site where you can learn programming for totally free! :fire:

# :question: How do I learn to code?
*answer*: Not by watching a bunch of youtube videos, but by understanding what you need. In ezpie you don't need to understand the code, but understand what your problem is. It's simple to just make a todo app with react by watching a video, but when ask to do it without one... You get the point right? So instand of just learning to code in ezpie you will learn how to covert big problems into smaller easy to understand chunk of code which you can understand and write without a video!! ðŸ˜®

# But why Ezpie??
Ezpie is not just free, it's also open-source so you can help others by sharing your programming ideas with them! Learning is fun and easy when you teach other what's in your mind!
