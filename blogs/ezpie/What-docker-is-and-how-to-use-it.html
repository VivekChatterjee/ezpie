            <h2 class="head">What is Docker?</h2>
            <p class="text">
                Docker is an open platform that allows us to develop, ship, and run apps with easily. It is packaged as
                containers(basically docker's standard unit). Containers are like normal loptops, they have all the
                requirements needed by a software.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                To explain this here's an example of how Docker can save your system from too much memory usage.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Say, you have three apps, each using its own libraries and dependencies. Now if you were to use a
                Virtual Machine(VM), then you could just say good bye to your laptop! As virtual machines use too much
                of memory usage they will crash your computer, casing more problems for your apps to work with.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Now lets use docker in place of virtual machines, docker can be customized so that it is small in size
                and more easier to maintain. Therefore you can create 100s of apps use docker to run them and all you
                need to do is customize docker and good bye to your memory protectors! Cause you don't need them now!

            <h2 class="head">In how many ways is docker better then virtual machine?</h2>
            <p class="text">
                Simple answer is, <b>in many ways!</b> Here's how docker is better then virtual machine:
            </p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Difference</th>
                    <th>Docker</th>
                    <th>Virtual Machine</th>

                    <td>Performance</td>
                    <td>Docker containers can start up quickly and result in less boot-up time</td>
                    <td>Virtual machines do not start quickly and therefore leading to poor performance</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Speed</td>
                    <td>
                        The application in Docker containers starts with no delay becuase the operating system is
                        already running
                    </td>
                    <td>Virtual machines takes a longer time to run applications</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>OS support</td>
                    <td>
                        Docker containers use the host operating system(main computer), and therefore they are
                        lightweight and less memory usage.
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        Virtual machine's use guest operating systems, that is typically another operating system inside
                        the computer, therefore they are a lot havy and memory usage.
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>portable</td>
                    <td>
                        Docker containers are easily portable, becuase they don't use saperate OS. As of this we can
                        share a linux app to a windows computer and it will run immediately as if running from linux!
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        Since virtual machines use saperate OS, we cannot share an app created on a windows machine to a
                        macOS machine.
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Time in creating</td>
                    <td>Docker being fast also creates a docker container in seconds</td>
                    <td>To create a virtual machine it takes a lot of time, as recreating an OS is hard!</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p class="text">
                So in simple terms, you can say that, 'Docker is a lot better than a virtual machine.'

            <h2 class="head">What's a docker image</h2>
            <p class="text">
                Like a totally normal image, which contains some details about the objects in it. The same way a docker
                image is something that contains information about your project like:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>required libraries</li>
                <li>files to run the project</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text">
                In simple terms, a docker image just defines your project in a way which the docker engine can
                understand and manipulate it.

                Now you know what docker is and how its useful, so now we can install docker in our system and get
                started
            </p>
            <p class="text">

            </p>
            <p class="text">
                First, we need to install docker desktop, its just basically the server engine which will start and run
                docker. Head over to
                <a href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/" class="link">docker desktop</a> and install as
                per your OS
            </p>
            <img src="../../asset/images/docker desktop image.png" alt="docker desktop home page" class="img"
                width="100%">
            <p class="text">
                After installing Docker desktop you will need to login/sign to <a href="https://hub.docker.com"
                    class="link">docker hub</a>
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                After this you can start docker desktop(also sign in to docker desktop) and click on the <i>show hidden
                    icons</i> button on the task bar. You can see that there is a icon on which when you hover will
                show, 'Docker Desktop running'
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                This means that we are all set to use docker!
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                In this prosess you may see a dialog saying that you have to install the linux kernel, if so then just
                click on the link which it displays. This dialog gets displayed, because docker can only be used in
                linux, docker can only be used in windows use a windows-subsystem for linux
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                After installing docker and it's required linux kernel, you can also, if using <a
                    href="https://code.visualstudio.com" class="link">vs code</a>, then you can also install an
                extension from which you can easily maintain your docker project.

            <h2 class="head">Docker in action</h2>
            <p class="text">
                Now lets see docker in action! For this I am using my old project which I explained in
                <a href="how-to-create-a-rest-api-using-flask.html" class="link">
                    How to create a rest api using flask</a>.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                You can clone the example from
                <a href="https://github.com/ishaan010/what-is-docker/tree/master" class="link">github</a>. This article
                will not focus on the explaination of the code, but on the code used for docker.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                After getting the code from github, you should add a file named <i>dockerfile</i>
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                <b>NOTE:</b> Naming the file dockerfile is important because docker only supports understanding for
                files that have the name dockerfile. There can be only one docker file in one folder.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Add the following code to the dockerfile:
            </p>
            <div class="code">
                <font class="keyword">FROM</font> python:alpine
                <br><br>
                <font class="keyword">COPY</font> requirements.txt . <br>
                <font class="keyword">RUN</font> python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
                <br><br>
                <font class="keyword">WORKDIR</font> /app <br>
                <font class="keyword">COPY</font> . /app
                <br><br>
                <font class="keyword">RUN</font> adduser -u 5678 --disabled-password --gecos "" appuser && chown -R
                appuser /app <br>
                <font class="keyword">USER</font> appuser
                <br><br>
                <font class="keyword">CMD</font> ["python", "api.py"]
            </div>
            <p class="text">
                This is simple, only thing you need is to think, the first, as it says 'from the base image python' this
                means that docker will create an image which will contain the python command, with that you can say that
                the run command on the 3<sup>rd</sup> line basically means that install all that things in the
                requirements.txt file.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Next, the COPY command, this command just copies the file mention, in this case the requirements.txt
                file. The WORKDIR command is just a command used to define the <i>working directory</i> of a Docker
                container. All the commands like <b>RUN</b>, <b>CMD</b>, <b>COPY</b> etc will be executed in the given
                working directory. But in simple terms, the command means combination of the <b>mkdir</b> and <b>cd</b>
                command.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Next, you can see is a simple command USER, let me explain this as a security threat:
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                If this RUN and USER commands are not used docker by default, will create a user called root, if you
                have ever used a linux OS you may have found this root quite often. That root is just the name of a
                user, if it's just a name then why did I said it's a security threat? Well, because it gives malicious
                code access in gaining permissions in the container host and distroying the container.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                So for safty reasons, you must always add these two lines of code, even if you don't have any idea of
                what it does or means. You can change the <i>adduser</i> to anything and the <i>appuser</i> too.
            </p>
            <p class="tex">
                Next and finally, there's the CMD, it's just a simple thing which runs the file api.py when we will run
                the image and create a container. So basically it means 'python api.py'
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                To create this even more quickly, you can use the extension which I told you to install, in your vs code
                press <kbd>ctrl+shift+p</kbd>, then type <kbd>Docker: Add Docker File to Workspace</kbd>
            </p>
            <video width="100%" loop controls>

            </video>
            <p class="text">
                Now you can run this docker file by typing <kbd>docker build -t docker:api .</kbd>
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                What this command does is, it tells docker to build an image using the dockerfile in this folder and
                name it <i>docker</i> with the tag <i>api</i>. And yes, you can change the name and tag to anything you
                want.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Now just follow this video and see how you can check your docker image and run it in docker desktop.
            </p>
            <video width="100%" loop controls>

            </video>
            <p class="text">
                As you can see in this video, we where using the test.py file to run and test the api. But I also
                mensioned that there is a dockerignore file, but then what's a dockerignore file for? Like it says it is
                used to <b>ignore</b> some files which are of no use in the project like, if the project is on github,
                we don't want the readme, contributing, and other docs used only for github right? And plus it increases
                the size of the docker image too!

            <h2 class="head">Publish your code</h2>
            <p class="text">
                Like I said before while explaining the first line in the docker file, python in that line is a base
                image available on docker hub. The same way you can also publish your code on docker hub as well!
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Lets try to publish our api in docker hub so others can use it too!

            <p class="text">
                First make sure your signed in to docker hub, next open a CLI and type this:

                > docker login
            </div>
            <p class="text">
                This just basically logins us into docker hub. Next what need to do is create a same image of your app,
                but it's name will be like this: <i>your Docker Username:tag name</i>. Which will give us this:
            </p>
            <div class="code">
                > docker tag docker:api ishaan010/whatisdocker:api

                Next, we need to push this new image to docker hub like this:

            <div class="code">
                > docker push ishaan010/whatisdocker:api
            </div>
            <p class="text">
                After this you can open <a href="https://hub.docker.com" class="link">docker hub</a>. Now click on the
                repositories tab and see your new docker image is now in docker!
            </p>

                alt="image of the repositories tab showing first docker image but in private" width="100%">
            <p class="text">
                For now you can see that your docker image is private, but you can change it to public like this:
