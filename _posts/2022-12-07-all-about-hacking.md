Hacking, is one of the **most important** things you need to know about in 2022, as well as the **other side** of hacking.

**NOTE**: This post is **not about how to hack** but about what, and how to prevent it. No hacking tools will be described(Will be caming up soon!)

## What is Hacking?

Hacking means gaining access to others people devices without having their permission.
Now adays people refer hacking to more commonly as **cybercrime**. Even though hacking is a bad thing, but it's also, by the way, used in companies to prevent a hacker or more precisely a **black hat hacker**(will come to that) from gaining access to their servers!

## Who a Hacker is?

A hacker most people often describe as evil and bad programmers, or more likely a self-taught whizard kid
or a bad guy programmer who is skilled at modifying computer software so that he can be use it in a way outside his range.

But that is what normal people think a hacker is! A Hacker is not always the bad guy in the scenario, it can also be a goverment spy, a person as a hacker's job too!

## Where is started?

The first attempts to hack into computer systems were made in the 1960s and since then goverment and
companies, tring to not get hacked, created the world's first ever **the good hacker** a **white hat hacker**, but where referred to as **tiger teams**. Their task was to discover Vulnerabilities in their
servers and systems - The first ever white hat hacker.

By the 1980s, personal computers became widespread, and hacking became a global phenomenon, in fact so common that it was a every day job! In 1995 IBMâ€™s John Patrick stared the term **ethical hacking**

## Types of Hacker

In terms of hacking, we mostly focus on The bad guys and good guys, for which we got **Black hat hackers** and **White hat hackers**, but since their can be no only that or only this, we have the middle men - **Gray hat hackers**, these ones are those who help others, but also hack without permission and ask for money or else, good bye to your data!

## But How do they hack??

OK done with the intro so lets dive into how to these normal programmers hack into servers and systems without letting us know?

The answer to this is straightforward, since hacking evolved a lot, thinks like hacking tools also came up to help these hackers in their task.

**NOTE**: Since I have mentioned at the top, we will not describe any hacking tools for now ðŸ˜¢

We will now go through a bunch of steps to see how thinks work.

The first thing as a hacker you will do is find info about the device your target uses like: Operating System, version, security systems and so on. But most important is what is the target's **IP address**.

An IP address is a unique address that tells a lot about a device on the internet. Say you have an IP address of like **192.158.1.38**, each number can range between 0-255.

With the help of just this **IP address** The hacker can find information about you like your city, ZIP code, or your ISP(**I**nternet **S**ervice **P**rovider), as well as your ISPâ€™s name.

But the main question raises is

### How do they get to know it?

Well it's easier then you think! All the time you spend in the internet visiting site to site, while doing so you always give away your IP address, as it's always required even if you don't won't to.
An IP address works as a, say signature for you while visting sites, this is then used for purposes like Authorities trying to find you, hackers trying to hack you, advertisers trying to understand your likes and acordingly display ads to you.

Mostly this is used mainly for companies as a way to know who visted their company's site, so in case of a hacker, they know who it was and where he was.

## How to prevent this from happening

No doubt that you are now totally scared of even using the browser for a few days, but don't worry cause if there is a way there is a well, or more likely, if there is a privacy hack there is a privacy protector.

### 1. Unique Passwords

No matter how much deep you dive into the ocean, you always see a fish!

Passwords are ultimately the most important thing to understand, in fact so important that you should never save your passwords in your browser, files, or anything in your device.

Creating a strong password is quite a deadly thing, as remembering that password will take a long time.
But you can always write down your password in a **paper** in place of your device.

For a bonus, you can also change your password in every **one month**. Like this, anyone trying to hack you will fail, as it can take more then days to crack password and keep changing your password will make it even more defcult to crack.

### 2. Virtual Private Network(VPN)

A VPN is a service that **encrypts your internet connection** and **hides your IP address and location**. When you use a VPN, your internet traffic is routed through an **encrypted tunnel to a server operated by the VPN provider**. This **server acts as a middleman**, relaying your traffic to the internet and protecting your identity and location from third parties.

Here are some ways that a VPN can protect you:

**Encryption**: VPNs encrypt your internet connection, making it difficult for anyone to intercept your traffic and read your data. This is especially useful when using public WiFi or when connected to an untrusted network.

**Anonymity**: VPNs hide your IP address and location, making it difficult for websites and online services to track your online activity.

**Security**: VPNs can protect you from hackers and other cyber threats by adding an extra layer of security to your internet connection.

**Access to restricted content**: VPNs can bypass censorship and allow you to **access websites and services that are blocked in your country**.

**NOTE**: _It's important to note that while VPNs can provide a high level of security and privacy, they are not foolproof. It's still important to use caution when online and to choose a reputable VPN provider._

## Concultion

No matter what you think about hackers, as bad guys, good guys, or what ever. But one thing is sure, hacking is illegal and can do harmful things to _you_ more then the target. But it's always a better choice to work as a good hacker and help people stay safe.
