You are seeing a really simple dataset down below

![a simple dataset of two different options](https://github.com/EzpieCo/ezpie/assets/104765117/6c79b26a-a65e-46b1-8fbd-015a192b36a0)

If I tell you to draw a line to separate the two colors you may come up with something like this:

This may not be accurate, but this is approximately the perfect fit for this dataset.
And now if I put any random dot like this:

<img src="https://github.com/EzpieCo/ezpie/assets/104765117/2f23adeb-37c0-4908-ab4b-d8928d4eba38" alt="a random dot in the dataset" loading="lazy">

You can easily say that the green dot belongs to the blue dot category. But now the question is, how can a machine tell wether the dot belongs to the red or the blue category?

Welcome to the

## Pytorch Machine Learning Crash Course

In this crash course you will learn about how you can teach a machine how to predict what is what with the help of python's machine learning framework Pytorch.

This Course is for anyone who want to know how they can make a machine do what requires human level intelligence.

In this course you will be thought the basic maths behind machine learning models, how they predict values, how they learn like humans and much much more!

## How to take this course?

You can take this course anyway you may want, but what I would prefer is that you may want to take one chapter and then do a little practice. Take notes of points which would be mentioned in red.

For the setup and installation, you don't need to install anything, all you need is a laptop with a browser and open [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com) on one tab and this page on another one.

This setup is more appropriate:
