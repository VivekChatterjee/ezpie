Our first question for you in this course is, "What is **Machine Learning?**"

Machine learning is the process of converting data into numerical values and looking for patterns in those values. Text, image, video, music, or anything else you can think of can be considered data.

But you can google it and discover answers as well, and that is exactly what we want you to do: google your response. The first rule of a machine learning engineer is to google your answer.

On search google it gives us this result:

_Machine learning is a subfield of **artificial intelligence (AI)** that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computer systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It is concerned with creating systems that can automatically analyze and interpret data, recognize patterns, and make predictions or decisions._

So I just give you a simplified version of what google' search result had to say, but this definition is also OK from my side.

But then you may say, "Ezpie, then how do we convert something like video or audio into numbers?". That is a good question, but that is one thing we don't have to do all by ourselves, we use different frameworks to deal with such problems such as PyTorch for python, which is the main talk of this course.

But how does it happens? Well that even I can't tell. But what I can tell is something like an image has something called pixel values, and if we take each pixel separately, we can see that each pixel has a hex value of RGB, now what's RGB? Well google that one for yourself and find out.

Now We can convert hex value into decimal values and say our data is now in numerical values, and feed those into the system to find patterns and understand what it is and then check if it got it right.

Machine learning or deep learning have one thing in common, they both need something known as a

which we will cover in the next chapter. A Neural Network is as the name suggests, is a network of neurons, neural networks are inspired by the human brain, that is also why we say AIs are just computers with human brains.
