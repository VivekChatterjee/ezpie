Today, we have a new question for you: "What is PyTorch?"

So, let's dive into PyTorch.

## What is PyTorch?

PyTorch is a Python framework designed for machine learning. While you might think it's just another Python framework, PyTorch stands out as the easiest framework to learn. In fact, you can grasp PyTorch in no time!

PyTorch offers simplicity that sets it apart from other Python machine learning libraries. It is the most popular deep learning framework and allows us to write and run machine learning code efficiently, leveraging the power of GPUs. For beginners in the field of machine learning, PyTorch is the go-to framework.

If you've heard of PyTorch's competition TensorFlow, you might be wondering why not choose TensorFlow instead. Let's compare these frameworks to demonstrate why PyTorch is the better choice.

As you can see from the graph above, PyTorch has the highest number of searches. While TensorFlow has the highest average, it's important to consider that TensorFlow was released earlier, which doesn't necessarily make it the best. Remember, old is not always gold. On the plus side, becoming proficient in PyTorch might even lead you to work at OpenAI!

Here's a nice video of Tesla using PyTorch:
